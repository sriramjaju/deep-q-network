This details the methodology used in evaluating and improving agent learning performance.

### Algorithm


### Neural Network Model

The neural network model maps the state (input) to actions (output). It consists of a two fully connected hidden layers, each with 32 nodes and using relu activation. Networks with one, two and three hidden layers were all tested and two was found to work best. The number of nodes in the hidden layers was tried with 16, 32 and 64, and 32 was found to work best.
